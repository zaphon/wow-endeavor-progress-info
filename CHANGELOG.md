# Changelog

All notable changes to Endeavor Tracker addon will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.8] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Added debounced refresh/update handling to prevent event storms from overwhelming the addon during rapid task completions.
  - `INITIATIVE_TASK_COMPLETED` now coalesces repeated refresh requests into a single delayed refresh.
  - `NEIGHBORHOOD_INITIATIVE_UPDATED` and `INITIATIVE_ACTIVITY_LOG_UPDATED` now coalesce repeated display updates.

### Performance
- Added one-time protection for global frame fallback scanning in `ProgressOverlay.lua`.
  - Prevents repeated full `pairs(_G)` scans when the neighborhood initiative frame is not immediately available.

### Technical
- `Controller/EndeavorTracker.lua`
  - Added `DebounceRefresh()` and `DebounceDisplay()` helper timers.
  - Replaced per-event `C_Timer.After` refresh/display calls in high-frequency events with debounced calls.
- `View/ProgressOverlay.lua`
  - Added `globalScanDone` flag and updated frame hook fallback logic.
  - Updated hook retry behavior to avoid repeated expensive fallback scans after initial attempt.
